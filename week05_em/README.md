#### Generative Models, Expectation-Maximization and Hidden Markov Models

Today's lecture will cover generative models, maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data using Expectation-Maximization and Hidden Markov models.

The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is a general algorithm for estimating models when some variables are not observed. We'll eventually use it to learn alignments between words in parallel text, but today we'll focus on some toy examples and some deciphering problems.
